## üöß Why music is removed?

In many jurisdictions (e.g., Korea), live radio broadcasts may play copyrighted music under blanket licenses.
However, **on-demand replay services** require separate music permissions.
To avoid copyright issues, this tool removes **all music segments**, even if the status is unclear.

> üîç This tool does not make legal judgments. It simply removes music to reduce copyright risk.
