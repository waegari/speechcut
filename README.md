# 🎙️ speechcut — Automatic Speech-Only Radio Replayer

Designed to support compliance with replay service policies and mitigate copyright risks.

## 🧠 Technologies

* **[YAMNet](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/audioset/yamnet)** (by Google): audio classification model for detecting music vs. speech
* **[Silero-VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad?tab=readme-ov-file)**: fast and lightweight voice activity detection model

## 🧭 Use Cases

* Creating **speech-only replays** of music radio programs
* Preparing **podcast versions** of live radio with music removed
* Automatically editing archives for **legal compliance**
* Speech analysis or summarization pre-processing

## 🚧 Why music is removed?

In many jurisdictions (e.g., Korea), live radio broadcasts may play copyrighted music under blanket licenses.
However, **on-demand replay services** require separate music permissions.
To avoid copyright issues, this tool removes **all music segments**, even if the status is unclear.

> 🔍 This tool does not make legal judgments. It simply removes music to reduce copyright risk.
